PyPA Sphinx Theme
=================

This is the common Sphinx theme for all PyPA projects.

It is derived from the `Python docs theme <https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme>`_,
since PyPA maintains portions of the default Python developer experience (specifically,
the software installation and distribution tools bootstrapped by the ``ensurepip`` module).

To use the theme either clone it directly with git, or else install it into your docs build
environment via pip::

    pip install git+https://github.com/pypa/pypa-docs-theme.git#egg=pypa-docs-theme
