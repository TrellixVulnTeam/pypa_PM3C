              By registering to upload materials to PyPI, I agree and
              affirmatively acknowledge the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                  "Content" means any data, content, code, video, images or
                  other materials of any type that I upload, submit, or
                  otherwise transmit to or through PyPI. Acceptable Content is
                  restricted to Python packages and related information.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Any Content uploaded to PyPI is provided on a non-confidential
                basis, and is not a trade secret.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I retain all right, title, and interest in the Content (to the
                same extent I possessed such right, title and interest prior to
                uploading the Content), but by uploading I grant or warrant (as
                further set forth below) that the PSF is free to disseminate
                the Content, in the form provided to the PSF. Specifically,
                that means:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    If I upload Content covered by a royalty-free license
                    included with such Content, giving the PSF the right to
                    copy and redistribute such Content unmodified on PyPI as I
                    have uploaded it, with no further action required by the
                    PSF (an "Included License"), I represent and warrant that
                    the uploaded Content meets all the requirements necessary
                    for free redistribution by the PSF and any mirroring
                    facility, public or private, under the Included License.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    If I upload Content other than under an Included License,
                    then I grant the PSF and all other users of the web site an
                    irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license
                    to reproduce, distribute, transmit, display, perform, and
                    publish the Content, including in digital form.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For the avoidance of doubt, my warranty or license as set forth
                above applies to the Content exactly in the form provided to
                the PSF, and does not, other than as may be provided in the
                Included License, grant the PSF or any users of the website a
                license to make or distribute derivative works based on my
                Content.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I further warrant that I do not know of any applicable
                unlicensed patent or trademark rights that would be infringed
                by my uploaded Content.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I represent and warrant that I have complied with all government
            regulations concerning the transfer or export of any Content I
            upload to PyPI.  In particular, if I am subject to United States
            law, I represent and warrant that I have obtained any required
            governmental authorization for the export of the Content I upload.
            I further affirm that any Content I provide is not intended for use
            by a government end-user engaged in the manufacture or distribution
            of items or services controlled on the Wassenaar Munitions List as
            defined in part 772 of the United States Export Administration
            Regulations, or by any other embargoed user.
